# TypeScript

## What & Why
* TypeScript is Super set to Java Script
* TypeScript adds static typing to Java Script
* Java Script on it's own is dynamically typed

## installation 
in you project directory <br>
`npm init -y` <br>
`npm install typescript`  <br>

## typescript won't run on browser, hence it is converted to javascript
* if our project has .config file which tells which files to compile then use `npx tsc` 
* if only compile a specfic file then use `npx tsc < filename >`
